#### Why I use Gnome DE?

Among numerous options for window management, such as BSPWM, Hyprland and others. Why did I choose to use Gnome? Simply for personal taste. I admire WMs, but Gnome has everything I need for my day to day and I feel productive with it. This is my opinion at the moment, but that may change in the future, I'm very interested in Hyperland. ü´£
