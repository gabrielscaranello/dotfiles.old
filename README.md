# Dotfiles [Arch Linux]

This is my Arch Linux installation setup. üòç

This guide translates my personal installation, with packages that I use in my daily life. Use as an example, never as an absolute truth! üòâ

Thanks if you have suggestions for improvement. Make forks at will... ü´£

#### Why I use Gnome DE?

Among numerous options for window management, such as BSPWM, Hyprland and others. Why did I choose to use Gnome? Simply for personal taste. I admire WMs, but Gnome has everything I need for my day to day and I feel productive with it. This is my opinion at the moment, but that may change in the future, I'm very interested in Hyprland. ü´£
